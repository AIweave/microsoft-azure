<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>

In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />

**Must Know**: [Network Security Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) is a tool in Azure that contains security rules that inspect incoming and outgoing traffic in a network for the allowing or denying of packages. [Wireshark](https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-wireshark-and-how-to-use-it) is the application used to capture and observe protocols being transmitted within a network.
